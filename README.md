# Code and Data for Physical and Cognitive Contributions to Fatigue Perception: The Interplay Between Local Muscle Fatigue and Sensory Prediction Error

## Data and Code for figures
The `Data and Code for figures`  folder contains all the data and code used in the figures presented in the paper. The code names correspond to the figure numbers, and the code can be directly run to generate the figures and perform automatic statistical tests.

## EMG_Preprocessing
The `EMG_Preprocessing` folder contains programs for EMG data pre - processing and gait division. These programs are designed to perform a series of operations on EMG signals, including cleaning, filtering, and segmenting. Additionally, they are capable of calculating the median frequency of the EMG signals. The median frequency is an important parameter that can reflect the power distribution of the EMG signal in the frequency domain, which is useful for analyzing muscle fatigue and activity patterns. After pre - processing, the data can be further used to classify different gait phases. The pre - processed data can be used for further analysis.

## Experimental_Arrangement
The `Experimental_Arrangement` folder includes programs for randomly assigning experimental arrangements to each subject. It also contains Temporal Error and Spatial Error data. The experimental arrangement programs ensure that each subject participates in different experimental groups in a random order, which helps to reduce experimental bias.

## Regress
The `Regress` folder stores all the regression programs used in the data processing process, as well as programs for calculating model fitting.

## Usage
To use the programs in this project, you need to have Python or MATLAB installed, depending on the programming language used in each program. Make sure to install all the necessary libraries before running the programs.

## Remarks
The primary datasets generated during this study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.
